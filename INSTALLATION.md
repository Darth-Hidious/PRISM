## ðŸ”§ Making It Work Like "uv install"

To make PRISM installable like `uv install prism-platform`:

### 1. Publish to PyPI
```bash
# Build the package
python -m build

# Upload to PyPI (requires account)
python -m twine upload dist/*
```

### 2. Create a Custom uv Source
```bash
# Add to your pyproject.toml
[tool.uv]
index-url = "https://pypi.org/simple/"

# Then users can install with:
uv add prism-platform
```

### 3. Docker Installation
```bash
# Pull and run PRISM container
docker run -it prism-platform:latest prism --help
```

## âœ… Verify Installation

After installation, test with:
```bash
prism --version
prism --help
prism list-databases
prism getting-started
```

## ðŸ›  Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Command not found**: Restart terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc`
2. **Permission errors**: Use `pip install --user` or virtual environment
3. **uv not found**: Install with `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
