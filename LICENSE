PRISM — Dual License

Copyright (c) 2025-2026 MARC27

This project uses a dual-license model:

1. Core plumbing (CLI, data collectors, tool registry, MCP transport,
   database layer, tests, documentation, and build tooling) is licensed
   under the MIT License. See LICENSE-MIT for the full text.

2. AI orchestration (agent core, skills, ML pipelines, simulation
   planning, validation logic, and plugin framework) is licensed under
   the MARC27 Source-Available License. See LICENSE-MARC27 for the
   full text.

The license boundary is documented in README.md.

If you are unsure which license applies to a specific file, the header
comment in that file takes precedence, followed by the table in
README.md. When no header is present, the following rule applies:

  - Files under app/agent/, app/skills/, app/ml/, app/simulation/,
    app/validation/, and app/plugins/ → MARC27 Source-Available License
  - Everything else → MIT License
